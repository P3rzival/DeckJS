Deck is a modern framework that lets you turn slide decks into fast, great looking webapps.

-   **Share what you want in the best format:**

-   **Keep the web powers:** 
    Slide decks are an amazing way of showcasing information, but in a world as wide as the web, 
    it's powers are not enough. Get the best out of both worlds, keep the slides format, keep the 
    webapp superpowers! 😱
    
-   **Keep it Simple, Saxophone:**
    Creating a web to shwocase some information shouldn't take ages. Creating  slide deck doesn't, 
    why would a web? Turn your ideas into reality in a matter of minutes using the Store 🐇
    
-   **Write in JS:**
    Oh come on, you know you love the fact that we are using React as much as we do! ❤️
    
-   **Official Web:**
    Have a look at a wek made with deck! That's right, the <a href="https://deckjs.borja.ai">official website</a> was made using deckJS! 🎉

## 🚀 Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

You can get a new Deck up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these three steps:

1.  **Create a Deck template with our npm package.**

    Get your deck set up in a single command:

    ```sh
    # clone the project
    git clone git@github.com:borjadotai/DeckJS.git
    ```

2.  **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

    Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

    ```sh
    # get inside the project
    cd deckJS
    # get it running in dev mode
    yarn dev
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the the `my-blazing-deck` directory in your code editor of choice (which will probably be VSCode or Atom 😜) and start editing. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Deck! For additional information on how you can customize your Deck, keep on reading this guide.

## 🎓 Learning Deck

Hello and welcome to the ultimate guide to learn how to use DeckJS! 🍿🥤

Let me start by telling you about the topics we are going to cover:

- Structure (How does deck look behind the scenes)
- Cover (What's the cover for)
- Store (How do I use the store)
- Content (Creating content in slides - Components)
- Ready? Launch it! 🚀 (How to deploy)

### Structure 
The moment you create a new template with Deck, you'll find a structure with the following relevant files and folders:
```
| node_modules (no explanation needed lol)
| public (this is were your static webapp will be when built)
| src
- | assets (place for all non code)
- | components (Necessary components storage)
- - | Cover.js (Main slide that you'll need to edit)
- | data
- - | content (Where the components that act as slide content live)
- - - | slide1 (example)
- - - | slide2 (example)
- - - | slide3 (example)
- - | Social.js (Social media setup)
- - | Store.js (THE STORE)
- | layouts
- - | all.scss (All styles are setup here)
- - | index.js (Main layout file)
- - | styles.scss (Custom scsss - worth having a look)
| gatsby-config.js (If you want to install any gatsby plugin)
```
Now that you have an idea of how a project looks like, let's get into understanding how everything works together.

### Cover
Even thought we are using the powerful slide deck format, we still are creating a webapp and so, if you want to have a very different and personal front page / main slide on top of everything else and a first piece of content, you can do so! 

The cover is the only slide that you can fully modify. As you can see in the structure, Cover.js is a file that lives inside src/components. As you can imagine, it is a component itself. If you have experience with React, feel free to go ahead and modify that component as you want! 

If you're new to react, it might be worth having a read at <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>

If you've played with component before, let me introduce you to a couple of friends:

- <a href="">Bulma</a>: Bulma is a great CSS framework that we use as base for our styles. 

- <a href="">Bloomer</a>: React library based on Bulma that had built in components usign those styles.

```js
<Hero isFullHeight isColor="primary">
    <HeroHeader>
      <Header />
    </HeroHeader>

    <HeroBody>
      <Container hasTextAlign="centered">
        <img src={logo} style={{ height: '12rem', margin: '0 0 2rem 0' }} />
        <Title className="is-size-2 is-size-4-mobile has-text-weight-light">
          Create your best presentation, as a <span className="has-text-weight-normal">static webapp</span> with <span className="has-text-weight-normal">DeckJS</span>.
        </Title>
        <Title className="is-size-3 is-size-5-mobile has-text-weight-light">
          Thanks for having installed DeckJS. Welcome to a new way of making webs.
        </Title>
        <Title className="is-size-4 is-size-6-mobile has-text-weight-light">
          Please give a star and upvote or like on whatever platform you found us! 🙏❤️
        </Title>
        <div className="isCentered">
          <iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=borjadotai&repo=deckjs&type=star&count=true&size=large" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="160px" height="30px"></iframe>
          <iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=twbs&repo=bootstrap&type=fork&size=large" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="158px" height="30px"></iframe>
        </div>
      </Container>
    </HeroBody>
  </Hero>
```

As you can see in the previous code, there is a big component called `<Hero>`, Heros define the slides that we use. We reccommend to keep this structure and just modify the content inside the `HeroHeader` and `HeroBody`. Here you have some more information around <a href="https://bloomer.js.org/#/documentation/layout/hero">Heros</a>!
